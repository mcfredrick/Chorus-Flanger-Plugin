TimeMachineDelay.vst3 is an audio plugin for use with VST3 compatible DAWs. To use the plugin in your DAW, simply copy the TimeMachineDelay.vst3 file to the VST directory used by your DAW. Consult your DAW manufacturer's documentation if you are unsure of the directory location. Once scanned by your DAW, TimeMachineDelay can be used as a delay effect on your tracks.

For standalone version (TimeMachineDelay.exe):
TimeMachineDelay.exe is a standalone version of the plugin. No installation is required.To try it, simply open the file one a Windows PC. Audio input is muted by default to avoid a potentially annoying feedback loop between your default input/output devices. To change audio settings, choose Options > Audio/MIDI Settings. But, be aware that you may cause the aforementioned feedback loop by unmuting the audio in this menu without first applying more appropriate I/O settings.
